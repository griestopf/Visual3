## Contents

The 12 Principles of Animation were introduced by Disney animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston in their book ‚ÄúThe Illusion of Life‚Äù (1981). These principles form the foundation of traditional and modern animation, helping bring characters and movements to life in a believable and appealing way.

üé¨ The 12 Principles of Animation
Squash and Stretch
Adds flexibility and weight. Think of how a rubber ball squashes when it hits the ground and stretches as it bounces back up.

Anticipation
Prepares the viewer for a major action. For example, a character crouches before jumping.

Staging
Presents an idea clearly. Involves placement, composition, and timing to focus the viewer‚Äôs attention on the most important part of the scene.

Straight Ahead Action and Pose to Pose
Two approaches to animation:

Straight Ahead: Animate frame by frame from start to finish (fluid and unpredictable).

Pose to Pose: Plan key poses and fill in in-betweens (structured and controlled).

Follow Through and Overlapping Action
Realistic movement where parts of the body or clothing continue to move after the main motion stops.

Slow In and Slow Out
More frames are added at the beginning and end of an action to make it feel more natural.

Arcs
Most natural movements follow an arc or curved trajectory rather than a straight line.

Secondary Action
Adds more life and dimension. Example: A character talks (primary action) while scratching their head (secondary action).

Timing
The number of frames affects the speed and weight of an action. More frames = slower, fewer = faster.

Exaggeration
Enhances emotion or action by pushing it beyond realism for greater impact.

Solid Drawing
The idea that drawings should convey three-dimensional form and weight, even in 2D animation.

Appeal
Characters and scenes should be interesting and engaging. It‚Äôs like charisma for drawings‚Äîclear design, personality, and storytelling help.

## Assignment

Use your Frame-by-Frame animation software of choice. If you don't have one: Use Pencil 2D.
