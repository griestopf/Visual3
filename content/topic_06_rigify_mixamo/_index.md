## Contents

- Follow the [Introduction to Rigify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3t_KjIuI7E) using your own (unrigged and unanimated) character to rig it with Rigify.
- Toy around and get to know the various FK and IK animation settings with the char.
- If you want your hand-made walk cycle appear in your Godot application, restart with the already Mixamo-rigged character and follow the instructions of the [Mixamo to Rigify](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdFJSZ3sZzvLgBO6etMZU2iqVBb6SIAfw) tutorials 

## Assignment

- Create a movement cycle using your character of choice rigged with Rigify.
  - Make it a variation of a standard walk, e. g. hopping, asymetrical, sideways, ....
  - Either use the Rigify standard armature or try integrating your walk cycle into the Mixamo-animated character.
